This project is a decentralized, serverless platform for storage and database management. It leverages the scalability and security of Arbitrum for its blockchain layer and runs on Eigen Compute for reliable, verifiable off-chain execution.

Each compute instance is provisioned with a unique `MNEMONIC` environment variable by Eigen Compute. This secret enables the deterministic generation of cryptographic wallets that are unique and exclusive to every instance, ensuring secure, isolated application execution and ownership.

Through this architecture, applications are empowered with their own cryptographically owned decentralized database. They can interact with and query their data securely using their individual private keys, guaranteeing data sovereignty, trustless access control, and seamless integration between smart contracts and off-chain compute/storage.

We also need an EIP-712 library for validating the signature of the server 
response onchain, if a user wants to push the response from the database 
query onchain.

A Database has a 10MB minimum, and a maximimum of 1 GB.  The server only has 16000 MB available, and we need to leave some buffer for the running processes.  When when you create your database, you need to say how much size you want allocated to it, and this will determine the linear decay rate based on the database size allocation.  you can increase this alloction if there is memory available.
